# **Movie Mindset Review App**

**Movie Mindset** is a React Application integrated with a custom [Sinatra API backend](https://github.com/goose20090/phase-3-project-backend). The platform provides a personalized space for movie enthusiasts to curate accounts, view reviews by other users, and share their own opinions. All updates synchronize seamlessly with the backend, with toast notifications confirming successful data transactions and backend updates.

Designed in part for Flatiron's Software Engineering Course's phase 3 project, further details on the project's criteria and alignment are available in the README of the [project's backend](https://github.com/goose20090/phase-3-project-backend).
